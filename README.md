# Linux Setup

This is my Linux setup which includes tmux, bashrc, vim, neovim and other essential software for day-to-day workflow

## useful apt installs

* git
* tmux
* vim
* code
* htop
* screen
* powerline (fonts-powerline as well)
* cmake
* cscope
* cmatrix
* neovim (install from release instead of apt)

To install: 

```bash
sudo apt install git tmux vim htop screen powerline cmake cscope cmatrix
```

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

## useful github install (for vim)

* CtrlP
* tmux-mem-cpu-load
